**Description of the Institute:**

Over the last century and a half, Seattle and the Puget Sound region have experienced major demographic and environmental transformations. This year’s institute provides students with an opportunity to undertake original research into the region’s histories that have been hidden from public view. What voices have been silenced or suppressed in the wake of these changes? Which have been brought to the fore? By using disciplinary frameworks drawn from across the Arts and Humanities, this immersive summer experience will celebrate the lives, and bear witness to the traumas, of the Seattle beneath. Through lectures, seminars, workshops, and experiential field excursions to “sites of memory” around the region, Seattle’s Upside Down proposes to unearth its layered histories, while actively disrupting the conventional narratives received through tourist and popular histories. The Summer Institute in the Arts &amp; Humanities will culminate in student-driven, original research projects that integrate digital, archival, and mixed-media resources.

**Course Learning Objectives:**
* Gain familiarity with key theories across several disciplines, including: Performance Studies, Tourism Studies, Environmental Humanities, Visual Culture Studies, Media Studies, and Ethnic Studies.
* Understand how learning to “see” the city is impacted by culture and technological processes.
* Identify and articulate how tours, museums, archives,  and other representation media, produce particular meanings that are laden with power.
* Be able to articulate how cultural works and practices other than the written word can be used to bear witness to and communicate knowledge about the past.
* Work with members of your cohort to develop an original  collaborative research project or paper that is connected to the course theme.

**SIAH Scholars Will:**
* Engage in conversation about under-researched and under-represented histories of Seattle and the Puget Sound Area
* Participate in Field Excursions around the area to learn from experts and community stakeholders, to bear witness to the lives and pasts of the people who have lived here, and to engage in embodied knowledge production.
* Engage in intensive research projects under the guidance of four interdisciplinary instructors on the UW Seattle campus.
* Be named Mary Gates Scholars and receive a $5,000 scholarship
* Present their research in the 2018 Summer Institute Symposium

**Required Readings and Viewings:**
* Students will be expected to read and critically engage with several short (essay- or article-length) readings per week.
* Students will also be expected to view films and other media related to the course and be ready to discuss them in class (Note: some readings and viewings will happen in class).
* All required readings and viewings will either be available as .pdf, .mp4, or .mov files through Canvas or through course reserve in Odegaard Undergraduate Library.

**Required Field Excursions:**

*   Bill Speidel’s Seattle Underground Tour
*   Duwamish Cultural Center & River Tour
*   Int’l District Walking Tour & Wing Luke Museum

The Final Research Symposium will be August 17th.

The Final Research Project will be broken down into several smaller parts to be worked on throughout the second-half of the course in a majority Group Work setting:

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**COURSE POLICIES**</span></p>
**Attendance:**
The Institute’s policy is that students are required to be in attendance in class sessions and field trips and to participate fully. The Institute comprises 12 credit hours of coursework in Humanities. Nine (9) of these credit hours come from instructional hours in the classroom and field trips. Three (3) hours are for required additional research and group work outside of the classroom. We have designed the calendar to allow for group work to take place at times and places mutually agreeable to all members.

If you know that you will miss a session or trip because of a conflict, or will arrive late or must leave early, please let a member of the teaching team know as soon as possible. In addition to class sessions and trips, all members of the Institute should plan to attend the orientation lunch and final Summer Institute Symposium.

If you miss a class, please check Canvas and consult with your classmates about what you missed. Please do not ask, “Did I miss anything?” – the answer is always yes! You are always welcome to schedule office hours with any member of the teaching team if you have questions about material you missed, but please get notes from a classmate first. You cannot make up in-class assignments that you missed.

Late assignments will lose a half a grade for every day late, up to a week, after which the assignment will not be accepted. If there is a serious reason for lateness, please consult with us as soon as you anticipate it.

**Weekly Schedule of Assignments:**
Generally speaking, Mondays and Thursdays will be devoted to discussion and activities in the classroom and Tuesdays will be devoted to field excursions. As we move toward the final weeks of the institute, we will begin focusing more meeting time on the final research projects.

Over the last century and a half, Seattle and the Puget Sound have experienced major demographic and environmental transformations: from an early history as a meeting place for Duwamish and other Coast Salish Peoples to rapid urbanization with the logging industry; from devastating fire to dramatic physical re-shapings of the topography into brand new cityscapes; from the racist removal and internment of Japanese Americans during the second World War to new challenges brought by gentrification and the influx of the tech industry. What voices and experiences have been silenced or buried in the wake of these changes? Which have been brought to the fore? We will look at our landscape from multiple perspectives, from ecocriticism to ethnic studies, from performance studies to queer studies, from public health to geography, and everything in between. By using these and other frameworks of understanding, this immersive summer experience will celebrate the lives, and bear witness to the traumas, of the Seattle beneath.

Over the course of A and B terms, we will explore the deeper and sometimes darker histories layered in and underneath the strata of Seattle and the Puget Sound area. Through experiential field excursions to “sites of conscience” in Downtown Seattle, Tacoma, and Puget Sound and its islands, as well as discussions, guest speakers, and classroom and online exercises, Seattle’s Upside Down seeks to actively disrupt the conventional narratives of our area received through tourist and popular histories. The Summer Institute in the Arts & Humanities will culminate in student-driven, original research projects presented at the end of the course. We encourage projects that integrate digital, archival, and mixed-media resources, drawing upon multiple disciplines, including art and performance. In so doing, together we will excavate pasts obscured by rapid change, observe presents excluded from public view, and imagine more just futures.
